If you need a dynamic, hierarchical data storage and retrieval mechanism, check out this package and profit!

I will take all contributions and package them up using VIPM. I will be compiling the packages myself and posting them here.

Requested contributions:
- Testing and bug fix requests,
- Bug fixes,
