- can store and retrieve tree attributes,
- is based on variants,
- can work with plugin classes,
- flattens and unflattens to XML,
- visualizes in a LV Tree Control,
- allows for easy interaction with Tree Control,
- is optimized for speed,
- provides a search by path functionality,
- is reference based and can beaeasily shared between threads,

I will take all contributions and package them up using VIPM. I will be compiling the packages myself and posting them here.
